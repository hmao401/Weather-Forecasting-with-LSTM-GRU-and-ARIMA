# Weather-Forecasting-with-LSTM-GRU-and-ARIMA
This project explores time series forecasting of climate and weather data using both classical statistical methods and deep learning approaches. The goal was to compare model performance in short-term forecasting (days ahead) versus long-term forecasting (weeks to months ahead).
